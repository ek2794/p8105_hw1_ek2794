##Problem 1 Penguins


```{r install}
library(tidyverse)
data("penguins", package =  "palmerpenguins")
head(penguins)

```
The mean of flipper length is `r mean(pull(penguins,flipper_length_mm), na.rm = TRUE)`

The mean of bill length is `r mean(pull(penguins,bill_length_mm), na.rm = TRUE)`

The mean of bill depth is `r mean(pull(penguins,bill_length_mm), na.rm = TRUE)`

The mean of body mass is `r mean(pull(penguins,body_mass_g), na.rm = TRUE)`


```{r}
ggplot(penguins, aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=flipper_length_mm, color=species)) + geom_point()
```
```{r}
ggsave("p8105_hw1_ek2794.pdf", height = 5, width=5)
```




## Problem 2 Vectors
```{r}

df = tibble(
  var_norm = rnorm(n = 10, mean = 5, sd = 1),
  vec_logic = var_norm > 0,
  vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i","j"),
  vec_factor = factor (c("low", "low", "low", "medium", "medium", "medium", "high", "high", "high", "high")))
  

```

The mean of the random sample is `r mean(pull(df,var_norm), na.rm = TRUE)`

The mean of the logical vector is `r mean(pull(df, vec_logic), na.rm = TRUE)`

The mean of the character vector is `r mean(pull(df, vec_char), na.rm = TRUE)`

The mean of the factor vector is `r mean(pull(df, vec_factor), na.rm = TRUE)`


```


as.numeric(pull(df, vec_logic)),

as.numeric(pull(df,factor_vector))
```

```

```


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
